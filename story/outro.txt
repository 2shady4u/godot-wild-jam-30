outro

You cursed man of tin!
such a grievance, such a sin!
You clockwork brute without finesse!
Such a catastrophe, such a mess!

Oh, what a world! what a place!
I can't be gone without a trace!
Who would have thought a clockwork heap of clunk
could turn my beautiful wickedness into junk!

*Long wail that starts loud and slowly goes to silence*
OOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooh
