You cursed Tin man are you there?
Such insolence barging into my lair!
My castle is not for you to hide.
I'll have you quartered, I'll have you tried!

That clockwork heart of yours is lost...
When I find it, I'll have it tossed!

You cursed Tin man can you hear?
Your friends don't want you near!
In fact, they would rather stay!
Their cells are cozy, their cells are gay!

You will regret the day our paths crossed...
You shall be defeated at all cost!

*outro cackle*
